 ## üè†  Abstract
Surround-view perception has garnered significant attention for its ability to enhance the perception capabilities of autonomous driving vehicles through the exchange of information with surrounding cameras. However, existing surround-view perception systems are limited by inefficiencies in unidirectional interaction pattern with human and distortions in overlapping regions exponentially propagating into non-overlapping areas. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatStitch, a surround-View human-machine co-perception system capable of unveiling obscured blind spot information through natural language commands integrated with external digital assets. To dismantle the unidirectional interaction bottleneck, ChatStitch implements a cognitively grounded closed-loop interaction framework based on Large Language Models. To suppress distortion propagation across overlapping boundaries, ChatStitch proposes SV-UDIS, a surround-view unsupervised deep image stitching method under the non-global-overlapping condition. We conducted extensive experiments on the UDIS-D, MCOV-SLAM open datasets, and our real-world dataset. Specifically, our SV-UDIS method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UDIS-D dataset for 3, 4, and 5 image stitching tasks, with PSNR improvements of 9\%, 17\%, and 21\%, and SSIM improvements of 8\%, 18\%, and 26\%, respectively.
